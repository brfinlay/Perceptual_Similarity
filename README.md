# Perceptual_Similarity

This script allows you to measure the perceptual similarity between two images, using Python imaging library's (PIL) **"structural similarity index"** (**SSIM**).

SSIM measures the perceptual difference between two images by quantifying the **perceived change** in **image structure**. SSIM processing is more similar to human perception compared to perceptual distance metrics e.g. the mean squared error (MSE), and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).

A SSIM score of 1 = perfect perceptual similarity (www.imatest.com/docs/ssim/).
